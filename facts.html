               <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The modern violin has been around for roughly 500 years. It was said to have been designed in the 1500â€™s 
                            by Andrea Amati.</li>
                        <li>Playing the violin burns approximately 170 calories per hour. Forget about your workout and start practicing 
                            harder!</li>
                        <li>Violins are typically comprised of spruce or maple wood.</li>
                        <li>Violins come in many different sizes. Typically, students will start learning violin at a young age with a 
                            1/32 or 1/16 size violin. As the student ages they will graduate up to a full sized violin.</li>
                        <li>Violins are very complex. Over 70 different pieces of wood are put together to form the modern violin.</li>
                        <li>The word violin comes from the Medieval Latin word vitula, meaning stringed instrument;</li>
                        <li>The world record in cycling backwards playing a violin is 60.45 kilometres in 5 hours 8 seconds.</li>
                        <li>The most expensive violin in the world was made by Giuseppe Guarneri in 1741. This extravagant violin was 
                            appraised with a value of $18 million.</li>
                        <li>Violin bows typically contain 150 to 200 hairs. They can be made up of  a variety of materials including 
                            nylon and horse hair.</li>
                        <li>Violin strings were first made of sheep gut (commonly known as catgut), which was stretched, dried, and 
                            twisted. Other materials violin strings have been made out of include: solid steel, stranded steel, or 
                            various synthetic materials, wound with various metals, and sometimes plated with silver.</li>
