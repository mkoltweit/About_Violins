                        <h2>Types of Violins</h2>
                        <p>The violin has changed over its lifespan for several different reasons, which has produced a variety of different 
                        types of instrument. Violin types can be roughly categorized into three groups: violins that vary in size, violins 
                        that vary because of genre, and violins that vary because of time period. These variations of the violin are 
                        essentially the same instrument, with mostly minor changes for stylistic, ease of learning, or developmental 
                        reasons. Some changes are easy to initiate - for example, in order to change a modern acoustic violin to a country 
                        fiddle you would essentially just need to change the bridge on the violin from a curved bridge to a flatter bridge, 
                        in most cases. However, other types of violin (in particular those that vary in size or because of time period) 
                        include variants which are more significant.</p>

                        <p>It is important to note that while these are the three main categories for types of violin, in general violins are 
                        very individualistic instruments. Variations in makers, country of origin, wood-types and make (for example, whether 
                        the violin has a one-piece or a two-piece back) also have a significant effect on the quality of the violin. </p>

                        <h2>Different Types of Violin by Size</h2>
                        <p>Violins vary in size mainly so that children can easily learn the violin. Violins that vary in size are known 
                            as 'fractional' violins because the different sizes of violin are recorded as fractions of a whole, full-size 
                            or 'four-quarter' violin.</p>

                        <p>Fractional violins can come as small as 1/64, although this is very rare. The smallest commonly played violin is 
                            the 1/16th, which is used by children aged 3-5, depending on the length of the child's arm. Violin sizes above 
                            1/16th include the 1/10th, 1/8th, 1/4 or 'quarter-size', the 1/2 or 'half-size' and the 3/4 or 'three-quarter' 
                            size.</p>

                        <p>A common way to measure what size of violin is right for the child violinist is to turn the violin back side 
                            up, and rest the back of the violin along the left under-arm of the child. If the child can reach the top of 
                            the scroll, then this is a good indication that the child will be able to manage this size of violin without 
                            dropping it, or becoming too cramped in the arm with too little space to play.</p>

                            <h2>Different Types of Violin by Genre</h2>
                            <p>
                                    While many of the violins categorised by time period could also be categorised by genre, these violins 
                                    have been specifically modified in order to suit the playing of particular music.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Fiddle</h3>
                            <p>The term 'fiddle' has been used as a slang term to describe the playing of a bowed stringed instrument since 
                                before the violin was invented. These days, while the term 'fiddle' can be used as a general term to describe 
                                a violin, it is most commonly used as a name to describe a violin used to play country or folk music from a 
                                range of different origins. The fiddle has a flatter bridge, to allow the player to perform double or triple 
                                stops more easily than on a classically arched bridge. Essentially the fiddle and the violin are the same 
                                instrument, which are mainly differentiated by the context and the style in which it is played. 'Fiddle music' 
                                can refer to music from many different countries including Ireland, England, Scotland, Poland, Hungary, 
                                Romania, as well as parts of America and many other countries.</p>
                            <h3>5-String Violin</h3>
                            <p>The 5 string can be either electric or acoustic, and as its name suggests it includes a 5th string - the C 
                                string (below the G string.) The 5-string violin combines the ranges of the violin and viola in the one 
                                instrument. The five-string violin can take some time to adapt to for four-string violin players as the angle 
                                that the bow touches a specific string changes. This type of violin adapts well to country fiddle music as it 
                                allows for the player to fill out the sound more with lower notes, and the decreased angle between strings 
                                makes it easier to perform double and triple-stops (playing two to three strings at a time).</p>
