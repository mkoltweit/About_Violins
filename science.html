                        The violin player creates sound by bowing one or more of the four strings. The bow hairs are rubbed in a sticky 
                        substance called rosin in order to make the strings stick to the bow. The action of the bow on the string causes 
                        the string to undergo a so-called slip-stick motion, in which the string travels with the bow for a time, and then 
                        slips in the other direction before being caught by the bow again a moment later. These oscillations happen many 
                        hundreds of times per second—196 times for the low G, which is the lowest note on the violin in standard tuning, and 
                        into the thousands for very high notes.<br /><br />
                        The strings themselves move almost no air and consequently produce almost no sound. Their vibrations are 
                        transmitted to the violin body through the bridge, which is a light piece of wood with two feet that stand on 
                        the violin belly. The total tension in the four strings is about 50 pounds, about 20 of which is directed straight 
                        down into the bridge. When a string is bowed, a force is created in the direction of the bow’s motion. As the bow 
                        pulls the string along, the force on the bridge increases in the direction of bowing. When the string slips, the 
                        force reverses direction to be opposite from the bow’s motion. Thus the force transmitted to the bridge takes the 
                        form of a sawtooth wave.<br /><br />

                        Any such periodic wave can be analyzed as a sum of pure tones, such as what we hear when we strike a tuning fork. 
                        Thus, when a violinist bows a string, he or she not only produces the fundamental pure tone that  he or she is 
                        trying to play, but also many harmonics, which are notes with frequencies that are integer multiples of the 
                        fundamental. For example, when a violinist bows "Concert A," which has a fundamental frequency of 440 cycles 
                        per second, the sound you hear contains pure tones of frequency not only 440 cycles per second, but also 880, 
                        1320, 1760, and so on. In the case of the sawtooth wave, the fundamental is twice as strong as the second 
                        harmonic, three times as strong as the third harmonic, and so on.<br /><br />
                        Underneath the foot of the bridge on the treble side of the instrument is the sound post, which is a thin 
                        cylinder of wood, wedged in between the top and bottom plates of the violin. In addition to supporting the 
                        top plate of the violin and coupling the oscillations of the two plates, the sound post essentially anchors 
                        the treble foot of the bridge to the top plate. The bridge responds to the driving oscillations from the bowed 
                        strings by pivoting about its treble foot, which converts the side-to-side motion of the bow into up-and-down 
                        motion of the violin belly. In addition, at certain higher frequencies the bridge seems to either aid or dampen 
                        out vibrations of the violin body. Despite its apparent simplicity, the role of the bridge in helping the violin 
                        produce sound is still not fully understood.<br /><br />
                        The top plate has two features that significantly affect the sound output. One—the f-holes—are obvious to anyone 
                        who has ever seen a violin. These s-shaped holes connect the air inside the instrument with the air outside, and 
                        this oscillating air is responsible for the violin’s lowest resonance. A resonance is a frequency at which the 
                        violin naturally tends to vibrate—most of us are familiar with resonances of objects like tuning forks, which, 
                        very soon after being struck, vibrate at one frequency and not any other. The violin’s lowest resonance is very 
                        similar to the noise you hear when you blow air across the mouth of a bottle (or the f-hole itself—try it!), and 
                        tends to fall around 300 cycles per second, near the open D string. The f-holes also play an important role in 
                        separating the area where the bridge stands from the rest of the belly, allowing this area to move much more 
                        easily in response to vibrations from the bridge.<br /><br />

                        The second feature of the violin’s top plate, which is less obvious because it is on the underside of the plate, 
                        is the bass bar, which serves several purposes—it further strengthens the top plate to withstand the string 
                        pressure; it couples the vibrations of the area between the f-holes, which oscillates relatively freely, to the 
                        more constrained part of top plate closer to the neck; and it prevents energy from being wasted in higher-frequency 
                        vibrations of the body that don’t produce much sound. The sound post and bass bar together break the symmetry of the 
                        violin body, thereby allowing the body to oscillate in different ways than if it were symmetrical, and generally 
                        increasing the sound output of the instrument.<br /><br />
                        A well-shaped top or bottom plate will naturally resonate in certain “modes.” These can be beautifully illustrated 
                        by placing some sand or other fine particle on the plate and vibrating it at varying frequencies until a mode is 
                        found, at which time the sand accumulates in bands. These bands are called nodes, and the sand moves to them because 
                        they are stationary points on the plate. The other parts of the plate are moving either up or down at a given time. 
                        These patterns are called Chladni nodes after Ernst Chladni, the German physicist who developed the technique of 
                        finding such patterns on vibrating plates. Many such modes exist, but makers concentrate on those at the lowest 
                        frequencies, tuning the plates either by tapping them to hear if they ring, or flexing them by hand.<br /><br />
                        The acoustics of the assembled violin body are fantastically complex, as they involve coupled oscillations of 
                        the strings, the bridge, the top and bottom plates, the ribs, and the fingerboard. The violin body resonances 
                        do not necessarily fall at the same frequency as the notes the player wishes to play, although the first 
                        (lowest-frequency) body resonance of instruments generally considered of high quality falls near the fundamental 
                        frequency of the open A string, 440 cycles per second. In general, the frequency spectrum of the sound coming 
                        out of the violin body is very different from the spectrum going in. For instance, the violin body has almost 
                        no response at the fundamental frequency of the open G string, which at 196 cycles per second is the lowest 
                        note on the violin in standard tuning. However, many of the harmonics (392, 588, etc) are well represented 
                        in the output spectrum, and, amazingly, the human ear never knows the difference. We think we are hearing 
                        G—a very acoustically rich version of G, but still G. More amazing still, the frequency spectrum of the 
                        sound produced by the instrument can change dramatically with a very slight change in the note being played, 
                        as when a player moves his or her finger on the fingerboard to produce vibrato, and yet the ear hears a 
                        smooth transition between neighboring pitches. As University of Birmingham (UK) physics professor and 
                        concert violinist Colin Gough puts it, "The ear is probably the world's most sophisticated spectrum analyzer."
